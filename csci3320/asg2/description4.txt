What are the number of samples and the number of features?
The number of samples: 10000
The number of features: 784


What is the best number of clusters? 
Briefly describe the figure you see. Feel free to state your insights about what you see.

so as the true number of label is 10, the best number of clusters shoulde be 10, but the result is not like that.

When the number of clusters is smaller than 10 will combine some similar group of picture together.
For example, 8 and 5, 9 and 7. The are being classifier as the same group.

When the number of clusters is bigger than 10 will also combine some similar group of picture together and form a new group.
Beside some clearer picture of 7 and 9 and 4, there are a new group that looks like all of them, like the mean image of them.
but other than that,the picture is clearer when the number of clusters increases.

And when we look at the score of different cluster we are using, the 12 clusters model had the highest scores.
It is funny that it has more class than the true label, but get highest scores.
I think it may because there may be some noise, which make those picture really hard to be classifier.
For example, the person may have a bad hand writing that mix the number 7 and 9.
The other reason is there may be different way to write the same number,
i had found out that 2 weird pictures. One is a vertical number 1, one is a number 1 with sloped.
It may be the reason why that it has a higher scores, because of the writing style.
