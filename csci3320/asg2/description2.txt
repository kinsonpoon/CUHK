To achieve POV larger than 0.9, how much dimensions should we preserve?
Number of dimensions: 62
Values: 0.9001260976046723

When we increasing the number of dimensions, the Pov increase. But the shape of the graph is concave down(increasing).
Therefore, to save time of computing, it is best to use 62 dimension out of 784 and achieve 0.9 POV.
